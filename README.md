#### An app which shows food trucks in san Francisco area

-------
used

- Google Maps API 
- OpenSfData for nearby food truck 


Related to app 
-------------------------

* read the data from raw/sample_truck_nearby.json

* used Google Maps Android Marker Clustering Utility for storing 100 markers in an optimized way.

* made an abstract class BaseMapActivity to write initial maps setup code.

Improvement (not happening due to time, proper API and icons)
--------

* I would have shown only nearby trucks if there are proper API belongs to our location. 

* I would have add filter options in the app.

* I would use firebase or run a service to update the truck location data in real-time. 

* I could use better icons to show the trucks on the map.
